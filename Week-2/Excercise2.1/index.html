      The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of the
      Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of
      the Indian Army, and its professional head is the Chief of Army Staff
      (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two officers have been conferred with
      the rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial
      position of great honour.Indian Army was formed in 1895 alongside the
      long established presidency armies of the East India Company, which too
      were absorbed into it in 1903. The princely states had their own armies,
      which were merged into the national army after independence. The units and
      regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated
      in several battles and campaigns around the world, earning many battle and
      theatre honours before and after Independence.The primary mission of
      the Indian Army is to ensure national security and national unity, to
      defend the nation from external aggression and internal threats, and to
      maintain peace and security within its borders.
